# AoC2023

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023].

[Advent of Code 2023]: https://adventofcode.com/2023

## To run
Use :
```lein run -m t.day01```
in the terminal.

Change `day01` as needed.

## Lessons (learned?)

### Day 01

Using `Integer.` is a bad idea.\
Capital Letter ==> java class\
Capital Letter + "." ==> constructor of the java class :\
    - creates new object
    - Integer : in 32bits  ==> max is 2.10^9 : not that much with advent of code and no warning/error
Solution : better to use integer 64bit: Long\
Let's **not** use `Long.` because again new object... instead : **`parse-long`**


### Day 02

#### `reduce` and `and`

```clojure
(defn iscolorok?
  [color numb cubes]
  (reduce (fn [a b] (and a b)) true
          (map (fn [b] (<= (parse-long (re-find #"\d+" b)) numb))
               (re-seq (re-pattern (str "\\d+ " color)) cubes))))
```
`reduce` needs a function of two elements\
`and` is _not_ a function so we have to define one\
we set `true` as a starting point in case the sequence has only one element

#### destructuring
 
with `fn [input]`\
and `input` is `[game color]`\
we can directly write: `fn[[game color]]` and call `game` and `color` in the rest

#### max
`max` is a function that exists ^^
