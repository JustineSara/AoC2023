## To run
Use :
```lein run -m t.day01```
in the terminal.

Change `day01` as needed.

## Lessons (learned?)

### Day 01

Using `Integer.` is a bad idea.\
Capital Letter ==> java class\
Capital Letter + "." ==> constructor of the java class :\
    - creates new object
    - Integer : in 32bits  ==> max is 2.10^9 : not that much with advent of code and no warning/error
Solution : better to use integer 64bit: Long\
Let's **not** use `Long.` because again new object... instead : **`parse-long`**
